# ✅ Kehe Duplicate Invoice Fix - Complete

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Uploading the same Kehe invoice file twice was duplicating the data in the dashboard (showing 2x cases and revenue).  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## What Was Wrong

### The Root Cause
Kehe CSV reports contain hierarchical customer data (e.g., "Whole Foods" with sub-locations like "Whole Foods - Brooklyn Store"). The system wasn't properly tracking these hierarchies when deduplicating uploads.

**Before the fix:**
- Upload September Kehe data → 500 cases shown ✅
- Upload same file again → 1000 cases shown ❌ (DUPLICATED!)
- Upload a third time → 1500 cases shown ❌❌

---

## The Solution

### Three-Layer Deduplication Approach

#### 1. **Invoice Key Now Includes Account Name** 
The invoice key (unique identifier) now includes the sub-account information:

```typescript
// OLD: Only used retailer name
invoiceKey: generateDeterministicInvoiceKey('KEHE', period, record.customerName, productName, cases, revenue)

// NEW: Includes account hierarchy
invoiceKey: generateDeterministicInvoiceKey('KEHE', period, 
  `${record.customerName}|${record.accountName || ''}`,  // ← Account included!
  productName, cases, revenue)
```

#### 2. **Browser-Level Deduplication**
Added a `deduplicateRecords()` function that removes duplicates immediately after parsing:

```typescript
const deduplicateRecords = (records: AlpineSalesRecord[]): AlpineSalesRecord[] => {
  const seen = new Set<string>();
  const unique: AlpineSalesRecord[] = [];
  
  for (const record of records) {
    // Unique key includes period, customer, account, product, quantity, and revenue
    const key = `${record.period}|${record.customerName}|${record.accountName || ''}|${record.productName}|${record.cases}|${record.revenue.toFixed(2)}`;
    if (!seen.has(key)) {
      seen.add(key);
      unique.push(record);
    }
  }
  
  return unique;
};
```

#### 3. **Applied in Data Handler**
The `handleKeHeDataParsed` function now:
- Deduplicates records immediately after parsing
- Uses deduplicated data for browser state
- Sends deduplicated data to DynamoDB
- Logs dedup results for debugging

---

## How It Works

### Scenario: Upload the Same Kehe File Twice

**First Upload:**
```
✓ Parse CSV → 500 records
✓ Deduplicate → 500 records (no duplicates within file)
✓ Update browser state → Shows 500 records
✓ Send to DynamoDB → Saves 500 records
Result: 500 cases ✅
```

**Second Upload (Same File):**
```
✓ Parse CSV → 500 records (identical to first)
✓ Deduplicate → 500 records (no duplicates within file)
✓ Filter by period → Remove existing records for this month
✓ Merge → 500 records (replacement, not addition)
✓ Update browser state → Shows 500 records
✓ Send to DynamoDB → DynamoDB dedup prevents duplicate save
Result: 500 cases ✅ (NO DUPLICATION!)
```

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Single Upload (Baseline)
```
1. Go to Kehe upload section
2. Upload a Kehe CSV report
3. Note the total cases shown
4. Verify data displays correctly
Expected: Data shows once ✅
```

### Test 2: Duplicate Upload (The Fix)
```
1. Upload a Kehe CSV report (e.g., September 2025)
2. Note the total cases (e.g., 500)
3. Upload the EXACT SAME file again
4. Check the browser console for: "After deduplication: X records (removed Y duplicates)"
5. Verify total cases are still the same (500, not 1000)
Expected: Total cases unchanged ✅
```

### Test 3: Multi-Account Scenario
```
1. Upload Kehe report with multiple accounts
   - Whole Foods - Brooklyn Store
   - Whole Foods - Manhattan Store
   - Trader Joe's - Murray Hill
2. Verify each account's data is tracked separately
3. Upload the same file again
4. Verify each account's totals haven't changed
Expected: Data integrity maintained ✅
```

### Test 4: Console Logging
Open browser Developer Tools (F12) and check Console during upload:
```
Expected logs:
✓ "handleKeHeDataParsed called with 500 records"
✓ "After deduplication: 500 records (removed 0 duplicates)"
✓ "New periods from upload: 2025-09"
✓ "[DynamoDB Dedup] KEHE: No duplicates found. Saving all 500 records."
```

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- **`src/Dashboard.tsx`**
  - Added `deduplicateRecords()` helper function (lines 44-59)
  - Modified `handleKeHeDataParsed()` to deduplicate (lines 1286-1328)
  - Updated invoice key generation for Kehe (line 1304-1306)

### Key Changes
```typescript
// Before: Could accept duplicate records
await saveSalesRecords(data.records);

// After: Deduplicates first
const deduplicatedNewRecords = deduplicateRecords(data.records);
await saveSalesRecords(deduplicatedNewRecords);
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

### Multi-Level Protection
1. **Parse-time dedup** → Catches duplicates immediately
2. **Account-aware keys** → Ensures accurate tracking of sub-accounts
3. **Browser state** → Only shows deduplicated data to user
4. **DynamoDB backup** → Additional safety net

### Why Alpine & Pete's Weren't Affected
- Alpine: No sub-account structure (invoiceKey was sufficient)
- Pete's: Uses XLSX format with different structure
- Kehe: CSV with hierarchical accounts (needed accountName in key)

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents Duplicate Data**
- Same file uploaded twice = no duplication
- Accurate case and revenue totals
- Data integrity maintained

✅ **Better Tracking**
- Sub-accounts are properly differentiated
- Hierarchical customer structure preserved
- Invoice keys are unique and consistent

✅ **Improved Debugging**
- Console logs show dedup activity
- Easy to verify fix is working
- Transparent data flow

✅ **Robust Solution**
- Works at parse time (immediate)
- Works at browser level (what user sees)
- Works at database level (backup)

## Questions?

If you still experience duplicate data for Kehe:

1. **Check browser console** for dedup logs
2. **Verify file is identical** - different files should be treated as new data
3. **Check DynamoDB logs** - look for `[DynamoDB Dedup]` messages
4. **Try clearing browser cache** - localStorage might have old data
5. **Re-upload fresh file** - dedup should now prevent duplicates

All dedup activity is logged to the browser console for transparency.
