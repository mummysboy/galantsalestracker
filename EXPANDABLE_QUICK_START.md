# Expandable Sections - Quick Start ðŸš€

## 30-Second Summary

âœ… Your script now has **clickable expand/collapse buttons** for nested data
âœ… They appear automatically when you upload data
âœ… No additional setup needed
âœ… All existing functionality still works

## What You Get

```
Before (Overwhelming):               After (Organized):
â”œâ”€ Customer 1                        [-] Customer 1 (expandable)
â”œâ”€ Product A                         [-] Customer 2 (expandable)
â”œâ”€ Product B                         [+] Customer 3 (collapsed)
â”œâ”€ Product C
â”œâ”€ Customer 2
â”œâ”€ Product D
â”œâ”€ Product E
â””â”€ Customer 3
  â””â”€ Product F
  
Users control what they see!
```

## How to Use (For Your Users)

### Step 1: Look Left
Find the **-** and **+** buttons on the left edge of the sheet

### Step 2: Click to Collapse
Click **-** to hide details

### Step 3: Click to Expand  
Click **+** to show details

Done! ðŸŽ‰

## Code Updated

Only one file changed:
- âœ… `FIXED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js` - Row grouping added

The script now:
1. Builds the data sheets (as before)
2. Creates expandable groups (NEW)
3. Applies grouping with proper nesting levels (NEW)

## What's New in the Code

### New Helper Functions
```javascript
createRowGroup()            // For future expansion
setupCollapsibleSection()   // For future expansion
```

### Updated Functions
```javascript
rebuildMonthlyViewFor()          // Now creates row groups
addCustomerBreakdownSection()    // Now creates row groups
```

## Testing It Out

1. **Upload some sample data** to your sheet
2. **Look for +/- buttons** on the left margin
3. **Click them** to collapse/expand sections
4. **Try multi-level** - collapse main customer, then expand a sub-vendor

That's it!

## Nested Levels

Your data has up to **3 nesting levels**:

```
Level 1: Main Customer (e.g., "Alpine Foods")
   â†“
Level 2: Sub-Vendor (e.g., "Store A - Downtown")
   â†“
Level 3: Products (e.g., "Coffee Beans")
```

Each level is independently collapsible.

## If It Doesn't Work

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No +/- buttons | Refresh page, try different browser |
| Buttons don't respond | Check edit permissions on sheet |
| Data looks wrong | This implementation doesn't change data, only display |
