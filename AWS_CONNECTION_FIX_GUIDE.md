# AWS DynamoDB Connection Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The application is showing "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist." error and not connecting to AWS DynamoDB.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **App.tsx was using regular Dashboard** instead of DashboardDynamoDB
2. **Environment variables are properly configured** (verified)
3. **DynamoDB table exists and is active** (verified)
4. **IAM permissions are working** (verified via CLI)
5. **The error is likely a browser extension conflict** - this specific error message is common with Chrome extensions

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated App.tsx to use DynamoDB Dashboard
```tsx
// Changed from:
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
// To:
import DashboardDynamoDB from './DashboardDynamoDB';
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Error Handling and Debugging
- Added middleware to DynamoDB client for request/response logging
- Added environment variable debugging function
- Created DynamoDBConnectionTest component for real-time testing

### 3. Enhanced DynamoDB Service
- Added detailed logging for all operations
- Added debug function to verify environment variables
- Improved error messages and stack traces

## Testing Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open browser developer tools and look for:
- Environment variable debug output
- DynamoDB request/response logs
- Any AWS SDK errors

### 2. Test Connection
The DashboardDynamoDB now includes a connection test component that will:
- Display environment variables (masked for security)
- Test a simple DynamoDB operation
- Show connection status

### 3. Browser Extension Issues
If you see "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.":
1. **Disable browser extensions** temporarily
2. **Try incognito mode** to rule out extension conflicts
3. **Clear browser cache** and restart browser
4. **Try a different browser** (Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Environment Variables Verification
Your current configuration:
```bash
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-west-1
REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***TDSM
REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***goWF
REACT_APP_AWS_APP_ID=dbqznmct8mzz4
```

## DynamoDB Table Status
- **Table Name**: SalesTracker-dbqznmct8mzz4
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Region**: us-west-1
- **Billing Mode**: PAY_PER_REQUEST
- **Item Count**: 0 (empty, ready for data)

## IAM Permissions Verified
The AWS user `RightImage` has proper DynamoDB permissions:
- ✅ PutItem (tested successfully)
- ✅ GetItem
- ✅ Query
- ✅ Scan
- ✅ DeleteItem

## Next Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Check the Connection Test
- Look for the "DynamoDB Connection Test" section
- Verify it shows "✅ Connected successfully!"
- Check browser console for detailed logs

### 3. Test Data Upload
- Try uploading a small test file
- Verify data appears in the dashboard
- Check that data persists after page refresh

### 4. If Still Having Issues

#### Check Browser Extensions
```bash
# Try in incognito mode or disable extensions
# Common problematic extensions:
# - Ad blockers
# - Privacy extensions
# - Developer tools extensions
```

#### Verify Network Connectivity
```bash
# Test AWS connectivity
curl -I https://dynamodb.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
```

#### Check AWS Service Status
Visit: https://status.aws.amazon.com/

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check DynamoDB Table
```bash
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name SalesTracker-dbqznmct8mzz4 --region us-west-1
```

### Test AWS Credentials
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### List Table Items
```bash
aws dynamodb scan --table-name SalesTracker-dbqznmct8mzz4 --region us-west-1 --limit 5
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Application loads** with DynamoDB dashboard
2. **Connection test shows success**
3. **Data uploads work** and persist
4. **No console errors** related to AWS SDK
5. **Data persists** after page refresh

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, you can temporarily switch back to Google Sheets:
```tsx
// In App.tsx, change back to:
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
```

The Google Sheets integration will continue to work as before.

## Support
If you continue to have issues:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Try different browsers
3. Disable browser extensions
4. Verify AWS service status
5. Check network connectivity to AWS
