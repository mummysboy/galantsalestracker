# Tony's Dashboard Duplicate Progression Data Fix

## Problem
The Tony's dashboard (and all other distributor dashboards) was **not allowing duplicate sales records** (which is correct), but **was allowing duplicate customer progression data** to be uploaded to the database.

This meant:
- ✅ Sales records were properly deduplicated 
- ❌ Customer progression (company progress) data was being saved repeatedly without any checks

## Root Cause
In the DynamoDB service (`src/services/dynamodb.ts`):
- **Sales Records**: Used `saveSalesRecordsWithDedup()` which checks for duplicate invoice keys
- **Customer Progression**: Used `saveCustomerProgression()` which created a new record every time with a new ID and timestamp - **NO DEDUPLICATION**

This meant progression data could accumulate indefinitely with every upload.

## Solution
Added a new method `saveCustomerProgressionWithDedup()` that:

1. **Checks if a progression already exists** for the same distributor and customer
2. **Deletes the old progression** if one exists
3. **Saves the new progression** (effectively updating/replacing the old one)
4. **Has fallback logic** if the dedup check fails

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/services/dynamodb.ts`
- Added new method: `saveCustomerProgressionWithDedup()`
- Logs all dedup operations for transparency
- Falls back to regular save if dedup check fails

#### 2. `src/hooks/useDynamoDB.ts`
- Added hook method: `saveCustomerProgressionWithDedup()`
- Follows same pattern as other DynamoDB operations
- Exported in return object

#### 3. `src/Dashboard.tsx`
- Updated ALL distributor data handlers to use `saveCustomerProgressionWithDedup()`:
  - Alpine
  - Pete's
  - KeHe
  - Vistar
  - Tony's
  - Troia
  - MHD

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `saveCustomerProgressionWithDedup()`

```typescript
async saveCustomerProgressionWithDedup(distributor: string, customerName: string, progression: any): Promise<CustomerProgression> {
  try {
    // Get existing progressions for this distributor
    const existingProgressions = await this.getCustomerProgressionsByDistributor(distributor);
    
    // Find if this customer already has a progression
    const existingProgression = existingProgressions.find(p => p.customerName === customerName);
    
    if (existingProgression) {
      // Delete the old progression record (replacement)
      console.log(`Found existing progression... Updating instead of creating duplicate.`);
      await docClient.send(new DeleteCommand({
        TableName: TABLE_NAME,
        Key: {
          PK: `PROGRESSION#${distributor}`,
          SK: `${customerName}#${existingProgression.id}`,
        },
      }));
    }
    
    // Save the new progression
    return this.saveCustomerProgression(distributor, customerName, progression);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error during dedup check: Falling back to regular save`);
    return this.saveCustomerProgression(distributor, customerName, progression);
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Before This Fix
```
Upload 1: Save customer progression → Row 1 in DB
Upload 1 again: Save customer progression → Row 2 in DB (duplicate!)
Upload 1 again: Save customer progression → Row 3 in DB (duplicate!)
Result: 3 identical progression records
```

### After This Fix
```
Upload 1: Save customer progression → Row 1 in DB
Upload 1 again: 
  - Check if progression exists → Found Row 1
  - Delete Row 1
  - Save new progression → Row 1 in DB (replaced, not duplicate!)
Upload 1 again:
  - Check if progression exists → Found Row 1
  - Delete Row 1
  - Save new progression → Row 1 in DB (replaced, not duplicate!)
Result: Only 1 progression record (always latest)
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Upload Tony's data once
2. Check DynamoDB - should see progression records
3. Upload the **same file** again
4. Verify:
   - Sales records were filtered out (deduplicated) ✅
   - Customer progression records were **updated/replaced** (not duplicated) ✅
5. Repeat multiple times - should always have same count of progression records

## Console Logs

The dedup process logs helpful information:
```
[DynamoDB Progression Dedup] TONYS/CustomerName: Checking for existing progression
[DynamoDB Progression Dedup] TONYS/CustomerName: Found existing progression with ID X. Updating instead of creating duplicate.
```

## Consistency

This fix applies to **all distributors**:
- Alpine
- Pete's
- KeHe
- Vistar
- Tony's
- Troia
- MHD

All now have consistent duplicate prevention for both sales records AND progression data.
