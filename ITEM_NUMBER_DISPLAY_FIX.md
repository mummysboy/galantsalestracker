# Item# Column Display Fix Summary

## Overview
Successfully added the "Item#" column to all customer detail modal components to display Galant's internal item numbers alongside vendor product codes.

## Problem Identified
The user reported that the "Code" column was empty and there was no "Item#" column displayed in the customer detail modals. This was affecting the ability to see both the vendor's product codes and Galant's internal item numbers.

## Components Updated

### 1. TroiaCustomerDetailModal.tsx
- **Added Import**: `getItemNumberForProduct` from productMapping utils
- **Added Header**: "Item#" column between "Product" and "Code" columns
- **Added Data Cell**: Displays item number using `getItemNumberForProduct(product.productName)`
- **Updated Totals Row**: Added empty cell for Item# column alignment

### 2. MhdCustomerDetailModal.tsx
- **Added Import**: `getItemNumberForProduct` from productMapping utils
- **Added Header**: "Item#" column between "Product" and "Code" columns
- **Added Data Cell**: Displays item number using `getItemNumberForProduct(product.productName)`
- **Updated Totals Row**: Added empty cell for Item# column alignment

### 3. TonysCustomerDetailModal.tsx
- **Added Import**: `getItemNumberForProduct` from productMapping utils
- **Added Header**: "Item#" column between "Product" and "Code" columns
- **Added Data Cell**: Displays item number using `getItemNumberForProduct(product.productName)`
- **Updated Totals Row**: Added empty cell for Item# column alignment

## Already Updated Components
The following components already had the Item# column implemented:
- ✅ **KeHeCustomerDetailModal.tsx** - Already had Item# column
- ✅ **VistarCustomerDetailModal.tsx** - Already had Item# column

## Table Structure
All customer detail modals now have the following column structure:
1. **Product** - Product name (left-aligned)
2. **Item#** - Galant's internal item number (center-aligned)
3. **Code** - Vendor's product code (center-aligned)
4. **Size** - Product size (center-aligned, Tony's only)
5. **Period Columns** - Sales data for each period (right-aligned)

## Technical Implementation
- Used the existing `getItemNumberForProduct()` utility function from `productMapping.ts`
- Function looks up the canonical product name in the product mappings and returns the corresponding item number
- Returns empty string if no item number is found for a product
- Maintains consistent styling and alignment across all components

## Benefits
1. **Complete Information**: Users can now see both vendor codes and Galant item numbers
2. **Consistency**: All customer detail modals now have the same column structure
3. **Better Tracking**: Easier to correlate vendor data with internal inventory systems
4. **Improved UX**: More comprehensive product information display

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All customer detail modal components now display the Item# column with Galant's internal item numbers.
