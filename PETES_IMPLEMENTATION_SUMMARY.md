## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Created
- **PETES_PRODUCT_CODES.md** - Quick reference guide for Pete's codes
- **PETES_PRODUCT_CODE_MAPPING.md** - Technical implementation details
- **PETES_CODES_SOLUTION.md** - Complete solution guide
- **PETES_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file

### 2. Code Changes

#### `src/utils/productMapping.ts`
- ✅ Added `petesProductCodes?: string[]` to `ProductMapping` interface
- ✅ Added Pete's codes to 7 products in `PRODUCT_MAPPINGS`
- ✅ Added CLARA'S descriptions to `alternateNames`
- ✅ Updated `createReverseLookup()` to include Pete's codes
- ✅ Updated `addProductMapping()` to support Pete's codes

#### `src/utils/petesParser.ts`
- ✅ Added product code header detection logic
- ✅ Added state tracking for `currentProductCode`
- ✅ Enhanced mapping to prioritize code matching
- ✅ Updated record creation to store Pete's codes in `productCode` field

### 3. Product Mappings Added

| Pete's Code | Galant Item# | Canonical Name |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 59975 | 321 | Uncured Bacon Breakfast Burrito |
| 59976 | 331 | Sausage Breakfast Burrito |
| 59977 | 341 | Chile Verde Breakfast Burrito |
| 59984 | 213 | Chorizo Breakfast Sandwich |
| 59985 | 451 | Pesto Provolone Breakfast Sandwich |
| 59986 | 841 | Turkey Sausage Breakfast Sandwich |
| 59987 | 211 | Bacon Breakfast Sandwich |

## How to Use

### Upload Pete's Reports
1. Open the Sales Tracker Dashboard
2. Click "Upload Reports"
3. Select "Pete's Coffee" as the distributor
4. Upload your Pete's sales report (Excel format)
5. The system will automatically:
   - Extract Pete's product codes (599xx)
   - Map them to canonical product names
   - Display codes in the Code column
   - Aggregate sales correctly

### Verify Results
After uploading, check:
- ✅ Code column shows Pete's codes (59975, 59976, etc.)
- ✅ Product names are canonical (not CLARA'S branded names)
- ✅ Revenue totals are correct
- ✅ All products are mapped (no "N/A" or unmapped items)

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Tracking** - Track sales by Pete's product codes
2. **Easy Reconciliation** - Match dashboard data to Pete's invoices
3. **Consistent Naming** - CLARA'S products map to standard Galant names
4. **Future-Proof** - New products easy to add following the same pattern

## Next Steps

### For Other Distributors
You can now apply the same pattern to other distributors:

1. **Extract product codes** from their reports
2. **Document the codes** (create DISTRIBUTOR_PRODUCT_CODES.md)
3. **Update productMapping.ts**:
   - Add `distributorProductCodes?: string[]` field
   - Add codes to each product
   - Update reverse lookup
4. **Update parser** (src/utils/distributorParser.ts):
   - Extract codes from reports
   - Map by code first, description second
   - Store codes in `productCode` field
5. **Test** with sample report
6. **Document** the implementation

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the Code column** - Should show Pete's codes (599xx)
2. **Check Console** - Look for unmapped product warnings
3. **Verify the report format** - Should have grouped headers with codes
4. **Review documentation** - See PETES_CODES_SOLUTION.md for details

## Success Criteria: ✅ ALL MET

- ✅ All 7 Pete's products have code mappings
- ✅ Parser extracts codes from grouped headers
- ✅ Codes map to canonical product names
- ✅ Codes display in dashboard Code column
- ✅ Tests pass (extraction + mapping)
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ No linter errors
