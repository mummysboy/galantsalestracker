# Google Sheets Integration - README

## üéØ Quick Start

Your Google Apps Script has been completely overhauled to fix case data and month accumulation issues.

### What You Need to Know

1. **The Problem is Solved** ‚úÖ
   - Case data is now accurate
   - No more extra months appearing
   - Re-uploading a month replaces it (doesn't duplicate)

2. **You Need to Update Your Script**
   - Copy the new code from `UPDATED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js`
   - Paste into Google Apps Script editor
   - Save

3. **You Should Clear Old Data**
   ```javascript
   clearAllData()  // Run this in Apps Script
   ```
   Then re-upload your reports from the SalesTracker app.

## üìä How It Works Now

```
Upload September Report
  ‚Üì
Script detects: "This is September 2025"
  ‚Üì
Script removes: Any existing September 2025 data
  ‚Üì
Script adds: New September 2025 data
  ‚Üì
Script keeps: All other months untouched
  ‚Üì
Result: September is updated, nothing else changed
```
