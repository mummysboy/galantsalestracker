# Google Apps Script - Fixes Applied

## 🔴 Problems Fixed

### 1. **No Data Persistence**
**Old Code (Lines 193-198):**
```javascript
function appendUnique_(sh, candidateRows) {
  if (!candidateRows || candidateRows.length === 0) return 0;
  // Does NOTHING - just returns count!
  return candidateRows.length;
}
```

**Fixed:** Added proper raw data storage using hidden `_RawData` sheets for each vendor.

---

### 2. **Erasing Other Vendor Data**
**Old Code (Lines 106-112):**
```javascript
rebuildMonthlyViewFor(alpineSheet, alpineRows);  // Only current upload!
rebuildMonthlyViewFor(petesSheet, petesRows);    // Only current upload!
rebuildMonthlyViewFor(keheSheet, keheRows);      // Only current upload!
// etc. - ALL vendors rebuilt with ONLY current upload
```

**Problem:** When you uploaded KeHe, it would rebuild ALL vendor sheets with only the current upload data, erasing everything else.

**Fixed:** 
- Only process and rebuild vendors that receive new data
- Read ALL existing data before rebuilding
- Each vendor maintains its own data independently

---

### 3. **Random Months Appearing**
**Cause:** No actual data was being stored, so the script had no way to track what months you'd uploaded.

**Fixed:** Raw data sheets now store ALL transaction data with proper duplicate detection.

---

### 4. **Incorrect Case Counts**
**Cause:** The script was only looking at the most recent upload, not accumulated data.

**Fixed:** Now reads all stored data and calculates accurate totals.

---

### 5. **No Dropdowns for Nested Data**
**Old Code:** No row grouping at all.

**Fixed:** Added collapsible row groups:
- Main customers can be expanded/collapsed
- Sub-vendors can be expanded/collapsed
- Products under each are grouped
- All groups start collapsed by default

---

## ✅ How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:
```
1. You upload KeHe September report
   ↓
2. Script creates/finds "KeHe_RawData" hidden sheet
   ↓
3. Reads existing data from KeHe_RawData
   ↓
4. Checks for duplicates (date|customer|product|invoice)
   ↓
5. Appends only unique new rows
   ↓
6. Reads ALL data from KeHe_RawData (existing + new)
   ↓
7. Rebuilds ONLY KeHe sheet with ALL data
   ↓
8. Other vendors (Alpine, Vistar, etc.) UNTOUCHED
```

### Data Storage:
```
Each Vendor has:
├── Main Sheet (e.g., "KeHe") 
│   └── Monthly view with all accumulated data
│
└── Hidden _RawData Sheet (e.g., "KeHe_RawData")
    └── All transaction records ever uploaded
        ├── July records
        ├── August records  
        ├── September records
        └── etc.
```

### Row Grouping:
```
Main Customer (clickable ▶)
├── Sub-Vendor 1 (clickable ▶)
│   ├── Product A
│   ├── Product B
│   └── Product C
├── Sub-Vendor 2 (clickable ▶)
│   ├── Product D
│   └── Product E
```

## 🎯 What's Different

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ No data storage - just rebuilt view each time
- ❌ Uploaded KeHe → All vendors got cleared
- ❌ Only showed current upload's month(s)
- ❌ Case counts were wrong (only from latest upload)
- ❌ No collapsible rows

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Data stored in hidden `_RawData` sheets
- ✅ Upload KeHe → Only KeHe gets updated
- ✅ Shows ALL months you've ever uploaded
- ✅ Case counts accurate (from all stored data)
- ✅ Collapsible row groups for hierarchy

---

## 🧪 Test It

### Test 1: Data Persistence
1. Upload KeHe September
2. Note the case count
3. Upload KeHe September again (same file)
4. **Expected:** Same case count (duplicates prevented)

### Test 2: Vendor Independence
1. Upload KeHe September
2. Upload Vistar September  
3. **Expected:** Both vendors show their respective data

### Test 3: Multiple Months
1. Upload KeHe July
2. Upload KeHe August
3. Upload KeHe September
4. **Expected:** All three months show data in KeHe sheet

### Test 4: Row Grouping
1. Upload data with hierarchical customers (e.g., "Vistar - Customer Name")
2. Go to Google Sheets
3. **Expected:** See collapse/expand arrows (▶) next to customer names
