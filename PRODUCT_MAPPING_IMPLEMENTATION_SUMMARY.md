# Product Mapping Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive **Product Name Mapping System** for your Sales Tracker that automatically standardizes product descriptions across all suppliers (Alpine, KeHE, Pete's, Tony's, Vistar, and MHD).

## Problem Solved

Previously, the same product appeared with different names depending on the supplier:
- Alpine: "GAL BURR BRKFST BACON"
- MHD: "MH400002"
- KeHE: "GLNT BACON BREAKF BURRITO"

This caused:
- ‚ùå Duplicate product entries in dashboards
- ‚ùå Inaccurate sales totals
- ‚ùå Confusing reports
- ‚ùå Manual reconciliation work

## Solution Implemented

‚úÖ **Automatic Product Name Normalization**
- All product names from all suppliers now map to canonical names from Master Pricing
- Happens transparently during data upload
- No manual intervention required

‚úÖ **Unified Dashboard**
- All reports show consistent product names
- Accurate aggregation across all data sources
- Clean, professional presentation

‚úÖ **Easy Maintenance**
- Simple dictionary-based system
- Tools to identify unmapped products
- Clear documentation

## What Was Created

### 1. Core Mapping System

**File: `src/utils/productMapping.ts`**
- Contains mappings for 32 products
- Maps item numbers, canonical names, and all known variants
- Provides functions to normalize product names
- Fast O(1) lookup performance

### 2. Analysis Tools

**File: `src/utils/buildProductMappings.ts`**
- Analyzes all sales data to find unmapped products
- Suggests mappings based on Master Pricing
- Generates template code for new mappings
- Run with: `npm run analyze-products`

**File: `src/utils/extractProductNames.ts`**
- Extracts all unique product names from sales files
- Helps identify naming patterns
- Useful for initial setup and ongoing maintenance
- Run with: `npm run extract-products`

**File: `src/utils/analyzeMasterPricing.ts`**
- Examines Master Pricing file structure
- Shows headers, columns, sample data
- Helps understand product data layout
- Run with: `npm run analyze-master-pricing`

### 3. Parser Integration

Updated all 6 parsers to automatically apply product mapping:
- ‚úÖ `alpineParser.ts` - Alpine TXT files
- ‚úÖ `keheParser.ts` - KeHE Excel files
- ‚úÖ `petesParser.ts` - Pete's Excel files
- ‚úÖ `tonysParser.ts` - Tony's Excel files
- ‚úÖ `vistarParser.ts` - Vistar Excel files

- Implementation overview
- What was built and why
- How to use the system

### 5. NPM Scripts

Added convenient commands to `package.json`:
```bash
npm run analyze-products         # Find unmapped products
npm run extract-products         # Extract product names
npm run analyze-master-pricing   # Examine Master Pricing structure
```

## Current Product Mappings

### ‚úÖ 32 Products Mapped Across 7 Categories:

1. **Breakfast Burritos** (6 products)
   - Uncured Bacon, Chile Verde, Sausage, Chorizo, Black Bean, Vegan Sausage

2. **Breakfast Sandwiches** (4 products)

## How to Use

### Day-to-Day Operations

**No changes required!** The system works automatically:

1. Upload sales files as usual
2. Product names are automatically normalized
3. Dashboard shows unified names
4. All done!

### Monthly Maintenance

When you add new products or get data from new suppliers:

```bash
# 1. Analyze for unmapped products
npm run analyze-products

# 2. Review the analysis
open product-mapping-analysis.json
open unmapped-products-code.txt

# 3. Add mappings to productMapping.ts
code src/utils/productMapping.ts

# 4. Test in dashboard
npm start
```

### Adding a New Product

1. Find the product in Master Pricing file:
   - Item #: e.g., `321`
   - Description: e.g., `Uncured Bacon Breakfast Burrito`

2. Add to `src/utils/productMapping.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     itemNumber: '321',
     canonicalName: 'Uncured Bacon Breakfast Burrito',
     alternateNames: [
       'GAL BURR BRKFST BACON',      // Alpine
       'MH400002',                    // MHD
       'GLNT BACON BREAKF BURRITO',  // KeHE
     ],
     category: 'Breakfast Burrito'
   },
   ```

3. Save and restart dashboard

## Key Features

### Normalization Process

1. Extract product name from sales file
2. Normalize (uppercase, trim, remove special chars)
3. Look up in mapping dictionary
4. Return canonical name if found
5. Log and return original if not found

### Performance

- Uses JavaScript `Map` for fast access
- No impact on dashboard load time
- Mappings loaded once at startup
