## ⚡ Quick Facts

### What's Fixed
- ✅ Case data is now accurate
- ✅ Only uploaded months show in Google Sheets
- ✅ Re-uploading a month replaces it (doesn't duplicate)
- ✅ Easy to clear specific months or vendors
- ✅ Upload tracking with metadata

### What's Different
- 🔄 Script uses month-based replacement instead of accumulation
- 🔄 Each upload is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- 🔄 New functions: `viewUploadedData()`, `clearMonthData()`, etc.

### What's the Same
- ✔️ Your SalesTracker app doesn't need any changes
- ✔️ The Google Sheet structure is the same
- ✔️ The monthly pivot view looks the same
- ✔️ Your web app URL still works

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**Before:**
```
Upload September → Shows July, August, September (3 months) ❌
Upload September again → Doubles the data ❌
Case count wrong ❌
```

**After:**
```
Upload September → Shows only September (1 month) ✅
Upload September again → Replaces September (not doubled) ✅
Case count matches source exactly ✅
```

## 🛠️ Most Common Commands

Once you've migrated, these are the commands you'll use:

```javascript
// View what's been uploaded
viewUploadedData()

// Clear a specific month from a vendor
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)

// Clear all data from a vendor
clearVendorData("KeHe")

// Clear everything and start fresh
clearAllData()
```

**How to run these:**
1. Open Google Sheet
2. Extensions → Apps Script
3. Select function from dropdown
4. Click ▶ Run
5. View → Logs to see results

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to do this?**
A: If you want accurate data and predictable behavior, yes. The issues you reported are now fixed, but you need to update the script.

**Q: Will this break anything?**
A: No. The new script is backward compatible. But you should clear old data and re-upload for accuracy.

**Q: How long does this take?**
A: 10 minutes following `MIGRATION_STEPS.md`

**Q: Can I undo this?**
A: Yes, you can paste the old script back. But you won't want to - the new one is much better!

**Q: Do I need to change my React app?**
A: No. The app continues to work exactly as before.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Read the troubleshooting section in `MIGRATION_STEPS.md`
