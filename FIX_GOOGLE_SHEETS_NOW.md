# Fix Your Google Sheets Issue NOW - Quick Start

## Your Problem
**"I uploaded data for 1 month, but Google Sheets shows 3 months of data and the cases are wrong"**

## Why This Happens
Your Google Apps Script **accumulates data** across uploads. When you upload September, it combines it with July + August that you uploaded before. This is by design, but it can cause issues if you:
1. Upload the same month twice (duplicates)
2. Have old data with incorrect case calculations

## Immediate Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Your Google Apps Script

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to **Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script**
3. Select ALL code (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
4. Delete it
5. Copy ALL code from `/Users/isaachirsch/Desktop/GalantCo/SalesTracker/UPDATED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js`
6. Paste it into the Apps Script editor
7. Click **Save** (üíæ icon)

### Step 2: Clear Duplicate/Problem Data

Choose the option that fits your situation:

#### Option A: Clear one specific month from one vendor
```javascript
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)
```
**Example:** `clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)` clears September 2025 from KeHe

#### Option B: Clear one month from ALL vendors
```javascript
clearAllVendorsMonthData(2025, 9)
```
**Example:** `clearAllVendorsMonthData(2025, 9)` clears September from all vendors

#### Option C: Start completely fresh for one vendor
```javascript
clearKeHeData()
```
**Available functions:**
- `clearAlpineData()`
- `clearKeHeData()`
- `clearMhdData()`

**How to run these:**
1. In Apps Script, select the function name from the dropdown at the top
2. Click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂)
3. Grant permissions if prompted
4. Check **View ‚Üí Logs** to see what was deleted

### Step 3: Fix Case Calculation Issues

Run these two functions in order:

```javascript
inspectAllVendorData()  // See what's wrong
fixAllVendorData()      // Fix it
```

**What this does:**
- Checks if your historical data has pieces instead of cases
- Automatically divides quantities by 12 where needed
- Rebuilds all vendor sheets with correct data

### Step 4: Verify the Fix

1. Look at your Google Sheets - check the "Total Cases" row
2. Compare with your Dashboard numbers
3. They should now match!

### Step 5: Re-upload Clean Data

If you cleared a month in Step 2:
1. Go back to your SalesTracker app
2. Upload the report for that month again
3. It will now show correct data without duplicates

## Vendor Names Reference

When using `clearMonthData()`, use these exact names:

- `"Alpine"`
- `"Pete's Coffee"`
- `"KeHe"`
- `"Vistar"`
- `"Tony's Fine Foods"`
- `"Troia Foods"`
- `"Mike Hudson"`

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I uploaded September twice"
```javascript
// 1. Clear the duplicate September data
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)

// 2. Re-upload September report from SalesTracker app
```

### Scenario 2: "All my data is wrong, need to start over"
```javascript
// 1. Clear everything for the problematic vendor
clearKeHeData()

// 2. Re-upload ALL reports for KeHe from SalesTracker app
```

### Scenario 3: "Cases are 12x too high"
```javascript
// 1. Check all vendors
inspectAllVendorData()

// 2. Fix the case calculations
fixAllVendorData()

// Done! No need to re-upload
```

### Scenario 4: "Show only the month I just uploaded"
**Note:** The Google Sheets are designed to show ALL months together. This is intentional for year-to-date tracking. If you want to see only one month:

```javascript
// Option 1: Clear all other months (not recommended)
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 7)  // Clear July
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 8)  // Clear August
// Now only September remains

// Option 2: Use filtering in Google Sheets
// - In the monthly columns, use Google Sheets' built-in filter feature
// - Hide columns you don't want to see
```

## Understanding the Monthly View

Your Google Sheets show a **year-to-date cumulative view** with:
- ‚úÖ Jan-Dec columns showing all months with data
- ‚úÖ New/Lost customer tracking across months
- ‚úÖ Customer ‚Üí Product breakdown
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical grouping (collapsible)

**This is intentional!** It helps you see trends across the year, compare months, and track customer retention.

## After the Fix

Going forward, to avoid this issue:

1. **Check before uploading** - See what months are already in Google Sheets
2. **Don't upload twice** - If you need to replace data, clear the month first
3. **Use the Dashboard** - The Dashboard shows per-period data without accumulation
4. **Use Google Sheets** - Google Sheets shows year-to-date cumulative data

## Still Having Issues?

Run this diagnostic:
```javascript
inspectAllVendorData()
```

Check the logs (View ‚Üí Logs) for:
- How many records per vendor
- Average case quantities
- Warnings about incorrect data
- Sample records for manual verification

## Summary - What You Did

‚úÖ Updated Google Apps Script with new helper functions
‚úÖ Cleared duplicate or problematic month data
‚úÖ Fixed case calculation issues (divided pieces by 12)
‚úÖ Verified that Dashboard and Google Sheets now match
‚úÖ Re-uploaded clean data if needed

**Your Google Sheets should now show correct data!** üéâ
