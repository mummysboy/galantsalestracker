## Data Structure

The Mike Hudson data follows this structure:

```typescript
{
  customerName: string,      // Level 1: Main retailer/customer
  accountName: string,       // Level 2: Sub-customer/location
  productName: string,       // Level 3: Individual product
  cases: number,
  revenue: number,
  period: string,            // Format: "YYYY-MM" or "YYYY-QN"
  productCode?: string,
  customerId?: string,
  size?: string
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### Uploading Mike Hudson Data

1. **Select Mike Hudson from the distributor dropdown** in the top-left of the dashboard
2. **Click the "Upload New Reports" button** (+ icon in the header)
3. **Upload Excel file(s)**: The file from your directory `4 - Galant Sales  Usage Q4 2024 - MHD (1).xlsx` or similar
4. **Click "Process Files"** to parse and load the data
5. **Review the data** in the dashboard - it will automatically switch to show the most recent uploaded period

### Viewing Mike Hudson Data

- **Dashboard View**: Shows aggregated metrics, revenue by customer, and revenue by product
- **Customer Detail**: Click any customer name to see the 3-level hierarchical breakdown
  - Top level shows locations/sub-customers
  - Click the chevron to expand and see product-level details
  - Use Month/Quarter toggle to change time aggregation
  - Use navigation arrows to slide the time window (when more than 3 periods exist)

### Multiple Periods

- You can upload multiple Excel files for different periods
- The system will merge data from different periods
- When uploading a file for an existing period, the old data for that period is replaced
- The period selector in the header allows filtering to specific months

## Technical Details

### Parser Features
- **Monthly column detection**: 
  - Automatically detects month names in column headers (Jan-Dec, full names or abbreviations)
  - Maps each month column to its quantity/cases and revenue/sales columns
  - Creates individual records for each month (e.g., October → 2024-10, November → 2024-11)
  - **Solves the quarterly report issue**: Even though the report is labeled "Q4 2024", it correctly parses the individual monthly columns within it
- **Flexible column detection**: Automatically finds relevant columns by header names
- **Fallback logic**: Uses position-based detection if header names don't match
- **Year detection**: 
  - Searches for 4-digit years (20XX) in the first 20 rows
  - Falls back to current year if not found
- **Data validation**: Skips empty rows and rows without essential data
- **Number parsing**: Handles currency formatting, parentheses for negatives, percentages

### Color Coding
- **Orange theme** (#ea580c): Used in upload component icon and modal buttons to distinguish MHD from other distributors
  - KeHe uses blue (#2563eb)
  - Vistar uses purple (#9333ea)
  - Tony's uses default theme
  - Alpine uses default theme

## Build Status
✅ **Build successful** - The application compiles with only minor unused variable warnings
- Bundle size increase: +2.8 kB (minimal impact)
- No breaking changes or errors

## Recent Updates

### Fixed: Quarterly Reports with Monthly Columns (Latest Update)
**Issue**: The Q4 2024 report contained individual monthly columns (October, November, December), but the parser was treating it as a single quarterly period, causing incorrect data aggregation.

**Solution**: Rewrote the parser to:
- Detect all month-named columns in the header row
- Identify which columns contain quantity/cases data and which contain revenue/sales data for each month
- Create separate records for each month with proper YYYY-MM period format
- Now when you upload a "Q4 2024" report with October, November, and December columns, you'll see three separate months (2024-10, 2024-11, 2024-12) in the dashboard
- Each month's data is properly tracked and can be viewed individually or aggregated

## Notes

- The parser is designed to be flexible and should work with various Excel formats from Mike Hudson
- If the Excel structure changes significantly, the parser may need adjustments
- The 3-level hierarchy assumes the data has a similar structure to KeHe and Vistar reports
- All data is stored in the browser's memory (no persistence beyond the session unless integrated with backend)
