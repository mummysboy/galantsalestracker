## 🔧 How the New Script Works

### Upload Flow Comparison

**OLD SCRIPT (Problematic):**
```
Upload September Report
  ↓
Read ALL existing data (July, August, etc.)
  ↓
Append September to existing data
  ↓
Store everything together
  ↓
Result: July + August + September all accumulate
Problem: Upload September again → DOUBLES the data!
```

**NEW SCRIPT (Fixed):**
```
Upload September Report
  ↓
Detect: "This contains September 2025 data"
  ↓
Read existing data
  ↓
Remove ANY existing September 2025 rows
  ↓
Add new September 2025 rows
  ↓
Keep all other months untouched
  ↓
Result: September is REPLACED, not added
Benefit: Upload September again → REPLACES old data, no duplication!
```

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Wrong Case Data
**Cause:** Historical uploads may have had incorrect calculations or duplicates
**Solution:** 
- Script now stores exact values from your uploads
- `clearAllData()` removes old incorrect data
- Re-uploading gives clean, accurate data

### Problem 2: Extra Months Appearing
**Cause:** Script was accumulating ALL data from every upload
**Solution:**
- Script now only stores the month(s) in each upload
- Upload September → Only September appears (unless you have other months)
- Months with 0 cases = not uploaded yet

### Problem 3: Duplicates When Re-uploading
**Cause:** Old script would add duplicate data
**Solution:**
- Script automatically detects month being uploaded
- Removes existing data for that month
- Adds new data
- Result: Idempotent uploads (safe to upload multiple times)

---

## 📊 Before & After

### Data Accuracy

**Before:**
```
Dashboard (Sep): 994 cases
Google Sheets:   12,450 cases ❌ (12x wrong!)
```

**After:**
```
Dashboard (Sep): 994 cases
Google Sheets:   994 cases ✅ (exact match)
```

### Month Visibility

**Before:**
```
Upload September only
Google Sheets shows: July, August, September ❌
Reason: Accumulated from previous uploads
```

**After:**
```
Upload September only
Google Sheets shows: September only ✅
Other months show 0 (not uploaded yet)
```

### Re-upload Behavior

**Before:**
```
Upload Sep (994 cases)
Upload Sep again
Result: 1,988 cases ❌ (DOUBLED!)
```

**After:**
```
Upload Sep (994 cases)
Upload Sep again
Result: 994 cases ✅ (REPLACED)
```

## 🛠️ New Capabilities

### Functions You Can Now Use

```javascript
// View upload history
viewUploadedData()
// Output: Shows all vendors, months, record counts, timestamps

// Clear a specific month
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)
// Removes only September 2025 from KeHe, keeps other months

// Clear a vendor
clearVendorData("KeHe")
// Removes all KeHe data, keeps other vendors

// Clear everything
clearAllData()
// Fresh start for all vendors
```

### Metadata Tracking

New hidden sheet: `_Upload_Metadata`

Tracks:
- Which vendor was uploaded
- Which month was uploaded  
- How many records
- When it was uploaded
- Whether it replaced previous data

### Upload Processing Flow

```
1. SalesTracker App
   └── User uploads report file
       └── App parses file
           └── Extracts: dates, customers, products, cases, revenue
               └── Sends to Google Apps Script via POST

2. Google Apps Script (doPost)
   └── Receives data
       └── Normalizes rows
           └── Categorizes by vendor
               └── For each vendor:
                   └── processVendorUpload()

3. processVendorUpload()
   └── Detects months in upload (e.g., "2025-09")
       └── Reads existing raw data
           └── Removes rows matching uploaded months
               └── Adds new rows for uploaded months
                   └── Writes to _RawData sheet
                       └── Rebuilds monthly view
                           └── Updates metadata

4. Result
   └── Google Sheet updated
       └── Only uploaded months are affected
           └── Other months remain unchanged
```

## 🔐 Security & Safety

### What's Safe
- ✅ Script runs in your Google account (same as before)
- ✅ No external APIs or services
- ✅ No data leaves Google's servers
- ✅ Same authorization model as before

### Backup Recommendation
- Create a copy of your Google Sheet before migration
- Keep original report files (Excel/CSV) for re-uploading
- Test with one vendor first before doing all

### Reversibility
- You can paste the old script back if needed
- But you won't want to - the new one is better!

---

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Efficiency Gains

**Old Script:**
- Read all data for all vendors on every upload
- Rebuild all vendor sheets every time
- No duplicate detection
- No month-specific operations

**New Script:**
- Only processes vendors receiving new data
- Only rebuilds affected vendor sheets
- Smart duplicate prevention via month replacement
- Month-specific clearing functions

### Impact
- Faster uploads (especially for single-vendor uploads)
- Less API quota usage
- More predictable behavior
- Easier debugging

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### After Migration, Test:

1. **Single Month Upload**
   - Upload September for one vendor
   - Verify: Only September shows data
   - Other months: 0 cases

2. **Multiple Month Upload**
   - Upload July, August, September
   - Verify: All three months show data
   - Totals: Correct sum

3. **Replacement Test**
   - Upload September (note case count)
   - Upload September again
   - Verify: Same case count (not doubled)

4. **Clearing Test**
   - Run: `clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)`
   - Verify: September removed from KeHe
   - Other vendors: Unchanged

5. **Metadata Test**
   - Run: `viewUploadedData()`
   - Verify: Accurate upload history
