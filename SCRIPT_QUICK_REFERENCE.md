## üéØ Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: I uploaded the wrong file
```javascript
// Clear the month you uploaded
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)

// Then upload the correct file from your app
```

### Scenario 2: Numbers look wrong for a vendor
```javascript
// Clear that vendor completely
clearVendorData("KeHe")

// Re-upload all reports for that vendor
```

### Scenario 3: I want to start over completely
```javascript
// Clear everything
clearAllData()

// Upload all your reports from scratch
```

### Scenario 4: I want to see what I've uploaded
```javascript
// View upload history
viewUploadedData()

// Check the Logs section for output
```

### Scenario 5: I uploaded September twice by accident
**No action needed!** The script automatically replaced the first upload with the second.

## üîç Checking Results

### After Running a Function:

1. **Check Logs:**
   - Apps Script: **View** ‚Üí **Logs**
   - Look for confirmation messages

2. **Check Metadata:**
   ```javascript
   viewUploadedData()
   ```

3. **Check Google Sheet:**
   - Go to the vendor's tab
   - Verify the monthly view looks correct
   - Months with 0 cases = not uploaded

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Vendor names must be exact:** "KeHe" not "kehe" or "KEHE"
- **Month is a number:** 1-12, not "January" or "01"
- **Clearing cannot be undone:** Always keep your original files
- **Uploads auto-replace:** You don't need to clear before uploading the same month again

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"ReferenceError: clearMonthData is not defined"**
‚Üí Make sure you've saved the updated script (üíæ Save button)

**"Exception: Service Spreadsheets failed"**
‚Üí Wait a moment and try again (Google API timeout)

**"No data to clear"**
‚Üí The vendor/month you specified has no data (this is OK)

**Function runs but nothing changes**
‚Üí Check View ‚Üí Logs for error messages

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always view metadata first:**
   ```javascript
   viewUploadedData()
   ```
   Know what's there before clearing!

2. **Test with one vendor:**
   Clear and re-upload one vendor to verify the system works before doing all vendors.

3. **Keep a log:**
   Note which files you've uploaded and when. The metadata helps, but your own notes are good too.

4. **One month at a time:**
   When fixing issues, handle one month at a time to avoid confusion.

5. **Verify after clearing:**
   After clearing, check the Google Sheet to confirm the data is gone before re-uploading.
