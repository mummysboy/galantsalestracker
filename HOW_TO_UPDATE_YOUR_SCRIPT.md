## Troubleshooting

### The old quarterly tabs are still there
- That's normal! Delete them manually if you want
- The new monthly tabs will appear after your next upload

### I don't see the new tabs
- Make sure you saved the script
- Try uploading new data through the app
- Check the "Logs" sheet for any errors

### Colors aren't showing
- The colors apply automatically when data is uploaded
- If you copied/pasted old code, make sure you got ALL of it

### New/Lost customers show zeros or "No new/lost customers"
- This is normal for the first upload or if there's no churn
- New customers: First appearance in the year
- Lost customers: Didn't order this month but did last month
- Data will populate as you upload more months

### Customer names showing with full paths (e.g., "Whole Foods - Oakland")
- This is correct! Sub-vendors are tracked separately
- Each location is treated as its own entity for tracking
- Main customer totals still roll up properly in pivot table
