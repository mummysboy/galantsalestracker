# Google Apps Script - Complete Overhaul Guide

## 🎯 What Changed

Your Google Apps Script has been **completely overhauled** to fix the fundamental issues you reported:

### Before (Old Behavior)
- ❌ Accumulated ALL data from every upload
- ❌ Uploading September showed July + August + September
- ❌ Uploading the same month twice would duplicate the data
- ❌ Case data could be incorrect from old uploads
- ❌ No way to see what months had been uploaded

### After (New Behavior)
- ✅ **Only stores the months you upload**
- ✅ Uploading September shows ONLY September (unless you also have other months)
- ✅ **Uploading the same month twice automatically replaces** the old data
- ✅ Each upload is isolated - no cross-contamination
- ✅ Upload metadata tracks what's been uploaded
- ✅ Case data is always correct from the source

## 🔑 Key Changes

### 1. Automatic Month Detection & Replacement
When you upload a file, the script:
1. Detects which month(s) are in the upload (e.g., "2025-09")
2. **Automatically removes** any existing data for those months
3. Adds the new data for those months
4. Keeps data for other months untouched

**Example:**
```
Current state: July, August data in Google Sheets

You upload: September report
Result: Google Sheets now has July, August, September

You upload: September report again (with corrections)
Result: Google Sheets still has July, August, September (new September replaced old)

You upload: October report
Result: Google Sheets now has July, August, September, October
```

### 2. Upload Metadata Tracking
A new hidden sheet `_Upload_Metadata` tracks:
- Which vendor was uploaded
- Which month was uploaded
- How many records
- When it was uploaded
- Whether it replaced previous data

**To view metadata:**
```javascript
// In Google Apps Script editor, run:
viewUploadedData()
```

### 3. No More Data Accumulation Issues
The script no longer "accumulates" data in the problematic way:
- Each month's data is isolated
- Uploading is **idempotent** (doing it twice = same as doing it once)
- No more mystery months appearing

### 4. Simplified Structure
```
Each Vendor has:
├── Main Sheet (e.g., "KeHe")
│   └── Monthly view with pivot table
└── Hidden _RawData Sheet (e.g., "KeHe_RawData")
    └── All transactions, organized by month

Plus:
├── _Upload_Metadata (tracks all uploads)
└── Logs (records upload activity)
```

## 📋 How to Update Your Script

### Step 1: Open Google Apps Script
1. Go to your Google Sheet
2. Click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
3. You'll see the current script code

### Step 2: Replace the Code
1. **Select all** the existing code (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
2. **Delete** it
3. Open `UPDATED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js` from your project
4. **Copy all** the new code
5. **Paste** it into the Apps Script editor

### Step 3: Save and Deploy
1. Click the **💾 Save** icon (or Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
2. The script is now updated!
3. **No need to redeploy** - your existing web app URL still works

### Step 4: Test It
1. Go back to your SalesTracker app
2. Upload a report (any vendor, any month)
3. Check Google Sheets - you should see only the data you uploaded

## 🧪 Testing the New System

### Test 1: Single Month Upload
1. Clear all existing data: Run `clearAllData()` in Apps Script
2. Upload September KeHe report from your app
3. Check Google Sheets KeHe tab
4. **Expected:** Only September data shows (month column has data, others are 0)

### Test 2: Multiple Month Upload
1. Upload July report
2. Upload August report
3. Upload September report
4. **Expected:** All three months show in Google Sheets

### Test 3: Replace Month
1. Upload September report
2. Note the case count for a specific customer
3. Upload September report again
4. **Expected:** Same case count (not doubled)

### Test 4: View Metadata
1. In Apps Script, run `viewUploadedData()`
2. Check the Logs
3. **Expected:** See a list of all uploaded months

## 🛠️ Available Functions

### Viewing Data

```javascript
// View what's been uploaded
viewUploadedData()
```

### Clearing Data

```javascript
// Clear a specific month from a vendor
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)  // Clears September 2025 from KeHe

## 📊 Understanding the Monthly View

The monthly view in Google Sheets shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MONTHLY SALES OVERVIEW - 2025                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Metric      │ Jan │ Feb │ ... │ Sep │ Oct │ ... │ Total │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Total Cases │   0 │   0 │ ... │ 994 │   0 │ ... │  994  │
│ New Cust    │   0 │   0 │ ... │  12 │   0 │ ... │   12  │
│ Lost Cust   │   0 │   0 │ ... │   0 │   0 │ ... │    0  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This shows:
✓ You've uploaded September (994 cases)
✓ You haven't uploaded other months yet (0 cases)
✓ 12 new customers appeared in September
```

**Important:** Months with 0 cases = not uploaded yet. Only months with data have been uploaded.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still seeing old data from months I didn't upload

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Clear all data and start fresh
clearAllData()

// Then re-upload your reports from the SalesTracker app
```

### Problem: Numbers don't match between Dashboard and Google Sheets

**Cause:** You may have old incorrect data in Google Sheets

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Clear the specific vendor
clearVendorData("KeHe")  // or whichever vendor has wrong data

// Re-upload that vendor's reports
```

### Problem: I uploaded a month but it's not showing

**Check:**
1. The date format in your upload file is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Run `viewUploadedData()` to see if it was recorded
3. Check the Logs sheet for errors

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check if data exists
viewUploadedData()

// If it's there but not showing, rebuild the view
// (This happens automatically on upload, but you can force it)
```

### Problem: Case data still looks wrong

**This should not happen with the new script** - it uses the exact case values from your upload.

**If it does:**
1. Check your source data (the file you're uploading)
2. Make sure the parser is calculating cases correctly
3. The script does NOT modify case values - it stores exactly what's sent

## 🎓 How It Works Under the Hood

### Upload Flow

```
1. You upload a report in SalesTracker app
   ↓
2. App parses the file and extracts:
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Customer name
   - Product name
   - Cases (quantity)
   - Revenue
   - Source (vendor name)
   ↓
3. App sends data to Google Apps Script
   ↓
4. Script receives data and:
   a. Detects which month(s) are in the data
   b. Reads existing raw data for that vendor
   c. Removes rows matching the uploaded month(s)
   d. Adds new rows for uploaded month(s)
   e. Rebuilds the monthly pivot view
   f. Updates metadata
   ↓
5. Google Sheet now shows updated data
```

### Data Storage

```
KeHe_RawData (hidden sheet):
┌──────────────┬────────────┬─────────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────┬─────────┬──────────────┐
│ Date         │ Customer   │ Product     │ Cases│ Revenue │ InvoiceId │ Source  │ UploadedAt   │
├──────────────┼────────────┼─────────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────────────┤
│ 2025-09-01   │ Whole Foods│ Banana Chips│  10  │  125.50 │ SYN-...   │ KeHe    │ 2025-10-15...│
│ 2025-09-05   │ Trader Joes│ Banana Chips│   8  │  100.40 │ SYN-...   │ KeHe    │ 2025-10-15...│
└──────────────┴────────────┴─────────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────┴─────────┴──────────────┘

When you upload September again, ALL rows with "2025-09-XX" are removed and replaced.
```

## 📝 Best Practices

### 1. Upload Reports in Order
While not required, it's cleaner to upload in chronological order:
- January → February → March → etc.

### 2. Use Upload Metadata
Check what's been uploaded before uploading:
```javascript
viewUploadedData()
```

### 3. Clear Before Fresh Start
If you want to start completely fresh:
```javascript
clearAllData()
// Then upload all your reports from scratch
```

### 4. Keep Original Files
Always keep the original Excel/CSV files you upload, in case you need to re-upload them.

### 5. Test with One Vendor First
When testing the new system:
1. Clear one vendor: `clearVendorData("KeHe")`
2. Upload one month for that vendor
3. Verify it looks correct
4. Then proceed with other vendors/months

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will this break my existing Google Sheet?**
A: No. The new script uses the same sheet structure. You can always restore the old script if needed.

**Q: Do I need to change anything in my SalesTracker app?**
A: No. The app continues to send data in the same format.

**Q: What happens to data I already uploaded?**
A: It stays there. But you may want to clear it and re-upload to ensure accuracy.

**Q: Can I still see year-to-date totals?**
A: Yes! The "Total" column shows the sum across all uploaded months.

**Q: How do I know which months I've uploaded?**
A: Run `viewUploadedData()` in Apps Script, or look at the monthly view - months with 0 cases haven't been uploaded.

**Q: Does this fix the case data issue?**
A: The script now stores exactly what you upload. If case data is wrong, check the parser in your SalesTracker app (keheParser.ts, vistarParser.ts, etc.).

**Q: Can I undo an upload?**
A: Not directly, but you can:
1. Clear the month: `clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)`
2. Re-upload the correct file

**Q: What if I need the old accumulation behavior?**
A: You can achieve it by uploading multiple months in one file, or by not clearing data between uploads (the new script won't clear months it doesn't receive).

## 📞 Support

If something isn't working as expected:

1. **Check the Logs:**
   - Google Sheets: View the "Logs" tab
   - Apps Script: View → Logs (or Ctrl+Enter)

2. **View Metadata:**
   ```javascript
   viewUploadedData()
   ```

3. **Start Fresh:**
   ```javascript
   clearAllData()
   // Then re-upload
   ```

4. **Verify Source Data:**
   - Check the Excel/CSV file you're uploading
   - Verify dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Verify case counts look correct

## 🎉 Summary

The new script fundamentally changes how uploads work:

**Old Way:** "Keep adding everything forever"
**New Way:** "Replace the month I'm uploading, keep everything else"

This means:
- ✅ No more mystery extra months
- ✅ No more duplicate data
- ✅ No more wrong case counts
- ✅ Predictable, reliable behavior
- ✅ Easy to see what's been uploaded

**Your uploads are now idempotent, isolated, and accurate!**
