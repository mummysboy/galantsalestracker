# Google Sheets Issue - Complete Summary

## What You Reported

> "When I upload data for 1 month, it shows data for 3 months and the data (cases) is not correct"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Data Accumulation by Design
Your Google Apps Script is designed to **accumulate data across uploads**, not replace it. This means:

- Upload July → Stored in hidden `KeHe_RawData` sheet
- Upload August → Combines with July, stored together
- Upload September → Combines with July + August, stored together
- **Result:** The monthly view shows ALL three months, not just September

### Issue #2: Potential Duplicate Data
If you upload the same month twice:
- The duplicate detection tries to prevent this using `date|customer|product|invoiceId` keys
- But synthetic invoice IDs may vary between uploads
- **Result:** The same month's data might be counted 2x or 3x

### Issue #3: Case Calculation Errors
Historical data may have incorrect case values:
- Old uploads might have contained piece counts instead of case counts
- When combined with new data, the totals are inflated (often 12x too high)
- **Result:** Google Sheets shows 12,450 cases when your Dashboard shows 994 cases

## What I've Done

### 1. Enhanced the Google Apps Script

**Added new functions:**
- `clearMonthData(vendor, year, month)` - Clear specific month from one vendor
- `clearAllVendorsMonthData(year, month)` - Clear specific month from all vendors
- `clearRawDataSheet_(ss, sheetName)` - Internal helper for replace mode
- Updated `doPost()` to support `replaceMode` flag (for future use)

**Existing functions you should know about:**
- `inspectAllVendorData()` - Check all vendors for case calculation issues
- `fixAllVendorData()` - Auto-fix case calculations for all vendors
- `clearKeHeData()`, `clearAlpineData()`, etc. - Clear all data for a vendor

### 2. Created Documentation

## How to Fix Your Issue Right Now

### Quick Fix (Choose One)

**Option A: Clear a specific month that was uploaded multiple times**
```javascript
// In Google Apps Script, run:
clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)  // Replace with your vendor, year, month
// Then re-upload that month's data from your app
```

**Option B: Fix case calculation issues**
```javascript
// In Google Apps Script, run:
inspectAllVendorData()  // Check what's wrong
fixAllVendorData()      // Fix it automatically
```

**Option C: Start completely fresh**
```javascript
// In Google Apps Script, run:
clearKeHeData()  // or clearAlpineData(), etc.
// Then re-upload all your reports from your app
```

## Understanding the Design

### The Accumulation Feature is Intentional

Your Google Sheets are designed to show a **yearly cumulative view**:

```
Monthly View Structure:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MONTHLY SALES OVERVIEW - 2025                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Metric  │ Jan │ Feb │ Mar │ ... │ Dec │ Total  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Cases   │ 100 │ 150 │ 200 │ ... │ --- │  450   │
│ New     │   5 │   3 │   7 │ ... │ --- │   15   │
│ Lost    │   1 │   2 │   0 │ ... │ --- │    3   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This shows your entire year at a glance!
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- ✅ See year-to-date totals
- ✅ Compare months side-by-side
- ✅ Track new/lost customers over time
- ✅ Identify trends and seasonality

**Drawbacks:**
- ⚠️ Can accumulate duplicate data if same month uploaded twice
- ⚠️ Shows all months together (not just the latest upload)
- ⚠️ Can combine old incorrect data with new correct data

### Your Dashboard vs Google Sheets

**Dashboard (React App):**
- Shows data **per selected period**
- Does NOT accumulate across uploads
- When you upload September, you see ONLY September
- Perfect for analyzing a specific month

**Google Sheets:**
- Shows data **for all periods combined**
- Accumulates across uploads
- When you upload September, you see July + August + September
- Perfect for year-to-date analysis

Both are correct - they just serve different purposes!

## Going Forward

### Best Practices

1. **Keep track of what you've uploaded**
   - Maintain a spreadsheet: "Uploaded KeHe Sept 2025 on Oct 15"
   - Check Google Sheets before uploading

2. **Before re-uploading a month:**
   - First clear it: `clearMonthData("KeHe", 2025, 9)`
   - Then upload the new file

3. **Check case calculations:**
   - Run `inspectAllVendorData()` monthly
   - If warnings appear, run `fixAllVendorData()`

4. **Use the right tool:**
   - Dashboard → Per-period analysis
   - Google Sheets → Year-to-date cumulative view

### When to Clear Data

**Clear a specific month:**
- You uploaded the same month twice by accident
- You need to replace incorrect data for one month

**Clear a vendor completely:**
- You want to start fresh with clean data
- Your historical data has systematic errors

**Fix case calculations:**
- Google Sheets shows 12x higher than Dashboard
- Inspection shows >30% of data may be incorrect

## Files Changed

- ✅ `UPDATED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js` - Enhanced with new clearing functions
- ✅ `FIX_GOOGLE_SHEETS_NOW.md` - Quick start guide (NEW)
- ✅ `GOOGLE_SHEETS_DATA_ACCUMULATION_FIX.md` - Comprehensive guide (NEW)
- ✅ `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary (NEW)

## Next Steps

1. **Read** `FIX_GOOGLE_SHEETS_NOW.md` for step-by-step instructions
2. **Update** your Google Apps Script with the enhanced version
3. **Run** the appropriate clearing/fixing functions
4. **Verify** that your data now looks correct
5. **Re-upload** any cleared data from your SalesTracker app

## Still Confused?

Think of it this way:

**What you expected:**
```
Upload July   → Sheet shows: July
Upload August → Sheet shows: August (replaces July)
Upload Sept   → Sheet shows: September (replaces August)
```

**What actually happens:**
```
Upload July   → Sheet shows: July
Upload August → Sheet shows: July + August (adds to July)
Upload Sept   → Sheet shows: July + August + Sept (adds to both)
```

**This is by design** to give you a yearly view. But you can now:
- Clear specific months if duplicated
- Clear entire vendors to start fresh
- Fix case calculations that were wrong

## Questions?

**"How do I see only September data?"**
→ Use your Dashboard in the SalesTracker app. Google Sheets is for yearly views.

**"Why does my Dashboard show different numbers than Google Sheets?"**
→ Dashboard shows one period. Google Sheets shows all periods combined. If they don't match for a specific month column, you may have duplicates or case calculation errors.

**"Can I make Google Sheets replace instead of accumulate?"**
→ Yes! The `replaceMode` flag is ready in the script. It just needs frontend integration (React components need to send `replaceMode: true`).

**"I cleared a month but it still shows in the sheet"**
→ Make sure you're running the function from Apps Script (not the browser console). Check View → Logs to see if it worked.

**"My changes to the script aren't taking effect"**
→ Make sure you clicked Save (💾) after pasting the new code.

## Summary

✅ Your issue is understood: accumulation + duplicates + case calculation errors
✅ Enhanced script with new clearing functions has been created
✅ Comprehensive documentation has been provided
✅ You can now clear specific months, vendors, or fix case data
✅ Going forward, you know how to avoid this issue
