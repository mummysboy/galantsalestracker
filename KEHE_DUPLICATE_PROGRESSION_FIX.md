# KeHe Duplicate Progression Fix

## Problem
Even after fixing record deduplication, progression data was still being duplicated when uploading the same KeHe invoice twice. 

**Root Cause:** The handler was saving progressions for ALL customers in the upload file, regardless of whether those records were new or deduplicated as duplicates.

## Solution
Modified `handleKeHeDataParsed()` in `src/Dashboard.tsx` to:

1. **Track saved records**: Changed `await saveSalesRecords(salesRecords)` to capture the return value as `savedRecords`
2. **Extract customers with new records**: Build a Set of customer names from records that were actually saved (not deduplicated)
3. **Save progressions selectively**: Only save customer progression data for customers that have NEW records in the database

## Implementation Details

### Before
```typescript
await saveSalesRecords(salesRecords);

// Always saved progressions for all customers in the upload
for (const [customerName, progression] of Array.from(data.customerProgressions.entries())) {
  await saveCustomerProgression('KEHE', customerName, progression);
}
```

### After
```typescript
const savedRecords = await saveSalesRecords(salesRecords);

// Only save progressions for customers with NEW records
if (savedRecords && savedRecords.length > 0) {
  const customersWithNewRecords = new Set(savedRecords.map(r => r.customerName));
  console.log(`[KeHe Progression] Saving progressions for ${customersWithNewRecords.size} customers with new records`);
  
  for (const [customerName, progression] of Array.from(data.customerProgressions.entries())) {
    if (customersWithNewRecords.has(customerName)) {
      await saveCustomerProgression('KEHE', customerName, progression);
    }
  }
} else {
  console.log('[KeHe Progression] No new records saved, skipping progression updates');
}
```

## How It Works

1. When a KeHe file is uploaded, records are deduplicated at the database level by `saveSalesRecords()`
2. That function returns only the records that were actually NEW and saved to DynamoDB
3. From those saved records, we extract the list of unique customer names
4. We then iterate through ALL progressions in the upload, but only save the ones for customers who have new records
5. If NO records were saved (all were duplicates), we skip progression saves entirely

## Result
- ✅ Records are not duplicated (already implemented)
- ✅ Progressions are not duplicated (NEW FIX)
- ✅ If the same file is uploaded twice, nothing new is saved to the database
- ✅ Customer progression analysis remains accurate

## Testing
After applying this fix:
1. Upload a KeHe invoice with customer data
2. Upload the exact same file again
3. Check DynamoDB:
   - Records should not increase (deduped)
   - Progressions should not increase (deduped)
4. Customer progressions should show accurate progression data for that customer
