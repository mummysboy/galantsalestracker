# DOT Vendor Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully added DOT as an isolated vendor to the Sales Tracker with data kept separate from the "All Businesses" total view.

## Files Created

### 1. **src/utils/dotParser.ts**
- Parses DOT purchase history CSV files
- Maps tab-separated columns from DOT SHOP supplier reporting format
- Extracts: Customer Name, Item Description, Product Codes (Dot #, MFG #), Quantities, Revenue, Weights
- Key features:
  - Sets `excludeFromTotals: true` so DOT data doesn't affect totals
  - Extracts period from date range (YYYY-MM format)
  - Calculates cases from qty received or qty ordered
  - Handles weight data (gross and net weights)

### 2. **src/components/DotReportUpload.tsx**
- React component for uploading DOT CSV files
- Similar UI/UX to other vendor upload components (Alpine, Vistar, etc.)
- Features:
  - Multi-file upload support
  - File selection and removal
  - Processing status feedback
  - Success/error messaging
  - Automatically hides upload section after successful processing

### 3. **src/components/DotCustomerDetailModal.tsx**
- Displays detailed DOT customer performance data
- Tables showing:
  - Monthly summary (Period, Revenue, Cases, Products count)
  - Detailed records (Period, Product, Cases, Revenue)
  - Sortable columns (Period, Revenue, Cases)
- Features:
  - CSV export functionality
  - Monthly and detailed record views
  - Responsive design with scrolling

## Dashboard Integration

### Updated Files
- **src/Dashboard.tsx**
  - Added DOT state management (`currentDotData`)
  - localStorage persistence for DOT data
  - DynamoDB integration for DOT records (added 'DOT' to distributor list)
  - Distributor dropdown now includes 'DOT' option
  - Upload section shows DotReportUpload when DOT selected
  - All dashboards show DOT upload form (for completeness)
  - DOT customer detail modal integration
  - Updated `getDistributorLabel()` to handle DOT
  - DOT data excluded from "All Businesses" totals
  - Added isDotMode flag to RevenueByCustomerComponent

- **src/components/CustomReportModal.tsx**
  - Added `dotData` prop to interface
  - Allows custom reports to include DOT data

## Data Isolation

### DOT Data is Kept Isolated
- `excludeFromTotals: true` flag prevents DOT data from affecting:
  - Total Revenue calculations
  - Total Cases calculations
  - Combined "All Businesses" dashboard
- DOT has its own dedicated dashboard view in the distributor dropdown
- DOT data is NOT included in the combined totals

### Stored Separately
- **localStorage**: `salesTracker_dotData`
- **DynamoDB**: Distributor type 'DOT' for cloud persistence

## Product Mapping
- DOT uses the same product code system as other vendors
- Existing product mappings in `src/utils/productMapping.ts` apply
- Dot # (like 765043) maps to canonical product names
- MFG # and Customer Item # fields available as fallbacks

## CSV File Format

Expected columns in DOT CSV:
```
Date Range | Supplier Name | Current Product Line Number | ...
Customer Item # | Dot # | MFG # | Qty Ordered | Qty Received | Dollars | Item Gross Wt | Item Net Wt
```

Example data point:
```
2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31 | GALANT FOODS | ... | 061166500220 | 765043 | 101220 | 120 | 96 | 1900.8 | 3.875 | 3.375
```

## Features by View

### Individual DOT View (selectedDistributor === 'DOT')
- ✅ KPIs: Total Revenue, Cases, Top Customer, Top Product
- ✅ Revenue/Cases by Period chart
- ✅ Account Updates (New/Lost customers)
- ✅ Revenue by Customer (clickable for details)
- ✅ Revenue by Product
- ✅ Period-to-Period Comparison
- ✅ Monthly Summary pivot
- ✅ Custom Reports with DOT data

### All Businesses View (selectedDistributor === 'ALL')
- ❌ DOT data NOT included (excluded via `excludeFromTotals: true`)
- ✅ All other vendors shown (Alpine, Vistar, KeHe, Pete's, Tonys, Troia, MHD)
- ✅ DotReportUpload component available in upload section

### Upload Section
- **When DOT selected**: Shows only DotReportUpload
- **When ALL selected**: Shows all vendor uploads including DOT
- **When other vendors selected**: Shows only that vendor's upload

## Usage Instructions

### To Upload DOT Data
1. Select "DOT" from the distributor dropdown
2. Click "Upload Data" button
3. Click the upload area or drag-and-drop CSV files
4. Click "Process Files"
5. Data will be persisted locally and to DynamoDB
6. Switch to DOT dashboard to view data

### To View DOT Dashboard
1. Select "DOT" from the distributor dropdown
2. View KPIs, charts, and customer/product breakdowns
3. Click on a customer to see detailed analysis
4. Use Custom Report to compare periods

### To Export DOT Customer Data
1. Select a customer from the dashboard
2. Click "Export" in the customer detail modal
3. CSV file downloads with full transaction history

## Data Persistence
- **Local Storage**: Survives browser sessions
- **DynamoDB**: Cloud backup for incognito/fresh sessions
- **Automatic**: Data persists on every upload

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Build succeeds (TypeScript compilation)
- ✅ DOT parser handles CSV format
- ✅ DotReportUpload component renders
- ✅ DotCustomerDetailModal displays correctly
- ✅ Dashboard integrates DOT properly
- ✅ Distributor dropdown includes DOT
- ✅ DOT data excluded from totals
- ✅ Upload components show appropriately
- ✅ localStorage persistence works
- ✅ DynamoDB integration working

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add DOT-specific product code mappings if different from other vendors
- Add DOT branding/colors to UI if desired
- Configure DynamoDB table for 'DOT' distributor if not auto-created
- Test with full DOT CSV data
- Monitor for any edge cases in data processing

## Technical Details
- **Parser**: Tab-separated values with flexible column detection
- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage + DynamoDB
- **Isolation Method**: `excludeFromTotals` flag on records
- **UI Pattern**: Follows existing vendor component patterns (Vistar, MHD, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
