# Alpine Product Codes in Dashboard - Solution

## Issue
The user is seeing "BAG" in the Code column instead of Alpine product codes (like 183981, 999982, 999986).

## Root Cause
The Alpine product code mapping has been implemented correctly, but the user needs to re-upload the Alpine report to see the updated product codes in the dashboard.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Re-upload the Alpine Report
1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click "Upload Reports" 
3. Select "Alpine" as the distributor
4. Upload the file: `IT415V_010525_050147.TXT`
5. The product codes should now show as Alpine codes instead of "BAG"

### 2. Expected Results
After re-uploading, the Code column should show:
- **183981** for Chicken Bacon Ranch Wrap
- **999982** for Bacon Breakfast Sandwich  
- **999986** for Turkey Sausage Breakfast Sandwich
- **999978** for Jumbo Beef Frank Bagel Dog
- **999979** for Jumbo Polish Sausage Bagel Dog
- And all other Alpine product codes

### 3. Verification
The Alpine parser now:
✅ Extracts Alpine product codes (183981, 999982, etc.)  
✅ Maps them to canonical product names  
✅ Stores them in the `productCode` field  
✅ Displays them in the Code column  

## Technical Details

### What Was Fixed
1. **Enhanced Product Mapping** - Added `alpineProductCodes` field to support Alpine's internal codes
2. **Updated Parser** - Now extracts Alpine product codes and stores them in `productCode`
3. **Improved Lookup** - Maps by Alpine code first, then falls back to description

### Code Changes Made
- `src/utils/productMapping.ts` - Added Alpine product codes to all products
- `src/utils/alpineParser.ts` - Enhanced to extract and use Alpine codes
- Dashboard now displays `record.productCode` which contains the Alpine codes

## If Issue Persists

If re-uploading doesn't work:

1. **Clear Browser Cache** - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check Console** - Look for any JavaScript errors
3. **Verify File** - Ensure the Alpine report file is the correct one
4. **Check Network** - Verify the upload is successful

## Test Data
The Alpine report contains these product codes:
- 183981: GAL WRAP CHIC BAC RAN
- 999982: GAL SAND BRKFST BACON  
- 999986: GAL SAND SSG TURKEY
- 999978: GAL BAGEL DOG BEEF
- 999979: GAL BAGEL DOG POLISH
- 183922: GAL BAGEL DOG BEEF FRANK
- 183923: GAL BAGEL DOG POLISH SSG
- 183924: GAL BAGEL DOG JALA CHS
- And 8 more products...

All should now display their Alpine product codes in the Code column.
